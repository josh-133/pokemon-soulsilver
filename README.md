Pokemon soulsilver in Python


What this project covers:

📝 Design Docs
	•	Writing Game Design Documents (GDDs) to outline gameplay mechanics, user interface, progression systems, etc.
	•	Create Technical Design Documents (TDDs) for each component (e.g., AI module, game engine, CI/CD pipelines).
	•	Use tools like Mermaid.js or PlantUML for architecture diagrams.

🧠 Machine Learning
	•	Implement a machine learning agent (e.g., using reinforcement learning) to play the game against the user or optimize NPC behaviors.
	•	You could use PyTorch or TensorFlow and train models on game state-action pairs.
	•	Use clustering or decision trees to generate difficulty scaling or predict player strategies.

🔁 Recursion
	•	Use recursion for AI algorithms (e.g., minimax with alpha-beta pruning), map generation (e.g., fractal terrains or dungeons), or tree traversal in decision-making.
	•	If you’re building procedural generation (e.g., maps or quests), recursion is a natural fit.

🔐 DevSecOps
	•	Build a secure CI/CD pipeline for deploying your game (and its backend if it’s online).
	•	Automate security scans (e.g., dependency scanning with GitHub Actions, container scanning if using Docker).
	•	Set up monitoring and alerting for server-side components (e.g., game matchmaking, leaderboards).
